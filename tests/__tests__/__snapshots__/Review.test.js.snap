        text="Beautiful hotel, we stayed for a few nights before our wedding (even though we are San Francisco locals) and it was a beautiful experience. The staff were so nice and thoughtful, the suite was large and spacious, an extremely comfortable bed and a dink g area big enough it have the family around for a meals to celebrate together. The staff are very attentive and the hotel feels very secure. 

The Redwood Room was great to gather friends and have drinks, stylish and has a great vibe. 

Overall we can’t recommend this place enough!"
